| microbes | A microbe, or microorganism, is a microscopic organism that comprises either a single cell (unicellular); cell clusters; or multicellular, relatively complex organisms. The study of microorganisms is called microbiology, a subject that began with Anton van Leeuwenhoekâ€™s discovery of microorganisms in 1675, using a microscope of his own design.

| domain | In biology, a domain refers to the largest of all groups in the classification of life. There are currently 3 agreed groups at this level, the Archaea domain, Bacteria domain, and Eukarya domain. Each domain contains a collection of organisms with similar properties and evolutionary histories, as scientists have organized them. It should be noted that while the three domain system is widely accepted and taught, it has been contested by a number of scientists. The supposed relationships between the three domains is discussed below. |
| kingdom | In the study of taxonomy, the rank of kingdom is just below domain, as seen on the image below. All of life, thought to come from a single origin, can be broken down into lower levels of classification, such as a kingdom or phylum. Each consecutive level represents a more related group of organisms. This structure has evolved from only a few kingdom taxon with 3 or 4 lower divisions, to kingdom being the second highest division and having 6 divisions within that structure. This is to accommodate the growing number of recognized species and our understanding of how they are related. |
